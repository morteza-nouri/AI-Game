# AI-Game
Artificial Intelligence Course - Computer Assignment 2 - University of Tehran - Spring 1401

## Goals:
- Learning Adversarial Search algorithm(minimax)
- How to formulate problems (Abstraction)
- Familiarity with decision making and game theory
- Familiarity with a variety of game strategies (zero-sum, general , ...)

## Description:
> In this project we want to develop an agent who play connect4 game with another player. We use minimax algorithm to find different combinations of possible moves for players (using backtracking) and then choose chain of moves to win. Because the state space of moves can be very large we use heuristic function and don't explore all depths in a decision tree to reach leaves.
